<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Rahul Jaiswar, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating dynamic and responsive websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in front-end development, but I’m also comfortable working with back-end technologies to deliver seamless user experiences.</p>

<p>I thrive on turning ideas into reality, whether it’s through building intuitive interfaces or optimizing performance. My approach combines creativity with technical expertise, ensuring that each project is not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I value collaboration and continuous learning, always looking to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing insights with fellow developers.</p>
